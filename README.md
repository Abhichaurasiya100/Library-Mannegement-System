# Library-Mannegement-System
Library Management System build using c++

Title of Micro Project
Library Management System
1.	Aim of the Micro Project:
The main aim of this project is providing an easy to handle and automated library management system. This project also provides features and interface for maintaining librarian’s records, student’s history of issue.
Library management system is all about organizing, managing the library and library-oriented tasks. It also involves maintaining the database of entering new books and the record of books that have been retrieved or issued, with their respective dates.
1.	Rationale:
A library is a pool of sources of information. This similar resource had made a well-defined community including readers, students etc. to refer or to borrow the book more conveniently. The Library Management System program for Library Management is used to find books easily. The library automation system automates the typical procedures of libraries and reduces the workload for library staffs. It makes the consistency of the record and the standard quality. When people value information more and more, the information industry got developed and the technology changed the expectations of library patrons. It gives both an opportunity and challenge to the libraries. The integrated library system is used to manage the more-complex activities and it enables the librarian to manage library resources in a more effective way to save time and effort.

The main objective behind this project is as mentioned below.

•	Increases efficiency  
•	Reduces the library management cost 
•	Fully authenticated system where student will have access to only resources which is given for student and admin can have all rights.
4.	Literature Review:
•	Polymorphism: The word polymorphism means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.
•	Class: The main purpose of C++ programming is to add object orientation to the C programming language and classes are the central feature of C++ that supports object-oriented programming and are often called user-defined types.
•	File Operation: Files are used to store data in a storage device permanently. File handling provides a mechanism to store the output of a program in a file and to perform various operations on it.
In C++, files are mainly dealt by using three classes fstream, ifstream, ofstream.
fstream: This Stream class signifies the output file stream and is applied to create files for writing information to files and reading information from file.
Ifstream: This Stream class signifies the input file stream and is applied to read information from files
ofstream: This Stream class signifies the output file stream and is applied to create files for writing information to files
Function of fstream class:
read (): It read the input from file.
write (): It writes information into file.
open ():  It open the file in specified mode.
close (): it is used to close the file after opening.
Modes used to project : 
ios::out: It open file in write mode
ios::in :It opens file in read mode
ios::trunc :It open file in write mode and truncates all data present in that file
ios::app :It open file and sets cursor at the end of the file.
